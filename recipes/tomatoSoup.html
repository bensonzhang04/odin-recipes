    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> This 4-ingredient creamy tomato soup for two blends 
        roasted onion with canned tomatoes and cream. 
        It could not be any tastier.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 onion, quartered</li>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes with basil, garlic, and olive oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup heavy cream, divided</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            Roughly quarter the onion half, and separate the pieces. 
            Place onion pieces on a baking tray. Open the can of diced 
            tomatoes. Carefully drizzle some of the liquid onto the onion.
        </li>
        <li>
            Roast onions in the preheated oven until soft, about 25 minutes. 
            Place onions and tomatoes in a high-powered blender, such as a 
            Vitamix. Cover tightly and blend on high for 40 seconds.
        <li>
            Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Carefully pour in the 
            tomato mixture, and cook, stirring occasionally until hot, about 
            3 minutes. Stir in 3 tablespoons cream.
        </li>
        <li>
            Ladle soup into bowls, and drizzle remaining cream over each serving.
        </li>
    </ol>
